 <a name="about_me"> 
   <p >Hello! I have worked at the intersection of medical image computing and signal processing. As part of my PhD thesis, I developed algorithms for tomographic reconstruction from low-dose and limited-projection measurements, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/">Dr. Ajit Rajwade</a>,  <a href="http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sharat/">Dr. Sharat Chandran</a> and <a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/imants-svalbe">Dr. Imants Svalbe</a>. A brief description of my thesis contributions is <a href="https://preetigopal.github.io/PhD-thesis/">here.</a></p>

  <p>I am now slightly shifting gears and I am exploring topics in theoretical machine learning with the <a href="https://a2i2.deakin.edu.au/">Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute</a> at Deakin University.</p> 

<p>Here's a copy of my <a href="resume.pdf">CV</a></p>

<h2>Favourite Resources</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-in/How+to+Read+and+Do+Proofs:+An+Introduction+to+Mathematical+Thought+Processes,+6th+Edition-p-9781118164020">'How To Read and Do Proofs'</a> by Daniel Solow. <br>
    An elegant and beautiful book
    describing the grammar (read "techniques and styles") behind mathematical proofs. Every proof has a structure and a content. This book describes the most commonly used structures and teaches when to use them in our proofs.<br>
    Understanding proofs is central to my work; yet, I had never been explicitely taught how to read them. Now I know. </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3Blue1Brown</a>. <br>
    A YouTube channel (with the best animations ever!) that covers concepts in probability, linear algebra, calculus and physics. I wish these were available in my school-days!</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eats,_Shoots_%26_Leaves">Eats, Shoots and Leaves</a> by Lynne Truss. <br>
    One of the wittiest books on punctuation marks out there. The writer dedicates one chapter for each punctuation mark (!) and illustrates the right way of using them alongside the most common ways they get misused. Definitely, a fun read.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style" >The Elements of Style</a> by William Strunk Jr. <br>
    The most commonly recommended text for improving English. Worth the buy.</li>   <li><a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Deep Work</a> by Cal Newport<br> A brilliant book that lays down the rules for doing deep focussed work, one of them being: never check your emails or phone while doing deep work (the context-switching between tasks robs your cognitive power). The book is also filled with anecdotes of people (may favourite, J.K.Rowling) who deliberately practised their craft by creating an environment with nearly zero distractions.</li>
  <li><a  href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite"> Writing In the Sciences</a> <br> A wonderful course to learn effective scientific writing.</li>

 <h2>Why go vegan?</h2>
   <p>Currently, one single industry is killing us and our planet-- the animal agriculture industry. Here's a  a list of scientific documentaries that discuss this.
     <ul>
       <li><a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowspiracy">Cowspiracy</a>: Explains how animal agriculture plays a key role in climate change and environmental degradation.</li>
       <li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Changers"> The Game Changers</a>: Breaks the myth that meat is necessary for outstanding athletic performance.</li>
        <li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_Health"> What The Health</a>: Uncovers why our current healthcare system promotes food products that cause cancer, diabetes, hypertension and other lifestyle diseases.   </li>
       <li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthlings_(film)">Earthlings</a>: Discloses what happens within the closed doors of slaughter houses, leather tanneries, zoos and animal labs.</li>

     </ul>
     It's time to go vegan!</p>
