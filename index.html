<p >Hi! I am a final year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay and School of Physics and Astronomy, Monash University. I work on medical image computing and I am being supervised by <a href="http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/">Dr.Ajit Rajwade</a>,  <a href="http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sharat/">Dr.Sharat Chandran</a> and <a href="https://www.monash.edu/science/schools/physics/ourpeople/svalbe">Dr.Imants Svalbe</a>.</p>

<p>My thesis deals with the development of reconstruction algorithms for Computed Tomography (CT) with an aim to reduce the exposed X-ray radiation to the subject being imaged. Towards this, I work on reconstruction from both few-view and low-dose measurements.  Some sub-problems I work on include: intelligent grouping of 2D slice measurements, registration in Radon and Fourier domain, and effective use of prior information in longitudinal studies. </p>
