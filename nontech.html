<h2>I love...</h2>
<p>-to jog by the Powai lake<br>
-to play, feed and talk to my hostel dogs- Chilli and Pepper :)<br>
-my Kalaripayattu classes. They challenge me to my core!<br>
-to eat [In Tamil&#45]  sakarai pongal, vendakai poriyal, mor kozhumbu and rasam prepared by my mother<br>
-to eat anjeer pak, dark chocolates, chocolate ice-cream, pasta made in my hostel mess and Theobroma cakes!<br>
-to talk to people who are passionately pursuing whatever they enjoy<br>
-to talk about all possible random topics in hostel mess<br>


<h2>I dislike...</h2>
<p>-taking a polythene bag for every small thing we buy<br>
-wasting plastic knifes, plates and bags (and not being re-used) in almost every birthday celebration at IIT<br>
-seeing huge number of posters being printed for all events in campus and then thrown away without being re-used on the back side</p>

<h2>Few mysteries...</h2>
<p>-How will IITB survive with its exponentially growing population?<br>
-If discovery of knowledge and scientific development is sacred, then why are we, as a society, more troubled today than any other time in history?<br>
-How will life on Earth end? (Am I being pessimistic? or realistic?!) - by world war 3? by global warming? or by mental insanity due to living in a virtual digital world most of the time?</p>

I turned vegan since mid-May, 2017 :) I has been one of the best decisions of my life.

Why? 

a) Because I became aware of the enormous torture that dairy cows go through:

Did you know?

- Dairy cows are artificially impregnated year after year and milked continuously.

- The calves are often deprived of their mother's milk.

- Once the cows stop producing milk, they're slaughtered. (That makes Dairy a slaughter industry, just as beef industry is!)

- In order to produce milk in large quantities, cows are also injected with hormones. These hormones affect our metabolism when we drink it.

b) Because I became aware that I actually don't need any milk! Infact, cow's milk is harmful for humans!

- All mammals are designed to get their milk from their mothers when they are babies. Once we grow, we don't need milk at all. 

- There's no other species that drinks milk of another species.

- Our blood is alkaline in nature. When we consume milk products (that have proteins i.e. amino 'acids'), our blood pH becomes low (acidic). The body fights back and buffers the acidity by leaching calcium and magnesium from bones. So, the fact that milk helps in building strong bones is a myth! 

- Cow's milk is designed for the growth of the new born calf to become an adult cow in 1.5-2 years. Do we grow at that rate?

-Did you know: the IGF1 (Insulin like growth hormone) in milk is one of the primary causes of cancer.

why did we never know that cow's milk is harmful for humans?

- Because of advertisements and false articles in media that are funded by Dairy industry. The Dairy industry also vehemently funds research on effects of cow's milk (and contrary to all peer reviewed research, the industry funded research always concluded that cow's milk is good for us. No-brainer! They have to run their business.

c) For the environment

-Animal farming is one of the top reasons for global warming, more than all the transportation in the world put together. 

-Large areas of forests are cleared to create space for factory farms. Result :we are loosing wildlife!

d) Because plant based choices are intuitive to us.

- If you walk by a yard and see fruits around, it will be natural to pluck and eat them.

- If you see a chick across the road., do you really feel like killing it and eating it? Do you salivate? can you kill and eat it raw? Most probably no! because, that's not who we are intuitively.

If there's anything that can help global warming and stop animal cruelty and benefit our health- all at the same time, that's a whole plant based diet. Period.

A whole plant based diet is devoid of meat, dairy and processed food.
