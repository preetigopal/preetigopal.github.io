    An elegant and beautiful book
    describing the grammar (read "techniques and styles") behind mathematical proofs. Every proof has a structure and a content. This book describes the most commonly used structures and teaches when to use them in our proofs.<br>
    Understanding proofs is central to my work; yet, I had never been explicitely taught how to read them. Now I know. </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3Blue1Brown</a>. <br>
    YouTube channel with the best animations ever (I challenge you to find a better one) that covers concepts in probability, linear algebra, calculus and physics. I wish these were available in my school-days!</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eats,_Shoots_%26_Leaves">Eats, Shoots and Leaves</a> by Lynne Truss. <br>
    One of the wittiest books on punctuation marks out there. The writer dedicates one chapter for each punctuation mark (!) and illustrates the right way of using them alongside the most common ways they get misused. Definitely, a fun read.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style" >The Elements of Style</a> by William Strunk Jr. <br>
    The most commonly recommended text for improving English. Worth the buy.</li>   <li><a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Deep Work</a> by Cal Newport<br> A brilliant book that lays down the rules for doing deep focussed work, one of them being: never check your emails or phone while doing deep work (the context-switching between tasks robs your cognitive power). The book is also filled with anecdotes of people (may favourite, J.K.Rowling) who deliberately practised their craft by creating an environment with nearly zero distractions.</li>
  <li><a href = "https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/" >Digital Minimalism</a> by Cal Newport <br>A must-read for anyone who wants to stop the compulsive behaviour of constantly checking his/her phone and/or social media.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gregmckeown.com/book/">Essentialism</a> by Greg Mckeown<br> A book that persuades us to refrain from commiting to myriad non-essential tasks, in exchange for our time and energy reserved for the essential tasks alone.</li>
  <li><a href="https://shop.konmari.com/collections/books" >Books by Marie Kondo </a> <br> A Japanese lady teaches how to keep <i>only</i> the stuff that sparks joy!</li>
  <li><a  href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite"> Writing In the Sciences</a> <br> A wonderful course to learn effective scientific writing.</li>
